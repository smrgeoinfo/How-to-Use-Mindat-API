# Mindat API examples

I'm using this repository for Jupyter notebooks or other useful code for accessing data in the [Mineral data information system (Mindat)](https://www.mindat.org/)

## What's here

### Using_the_Mindat_API.ipynb
A python note book that walks through connecting to the API to access information about meteorite classes. Examples use the geomaterials_search with a text query parameter, the geomaterials endpoint accessing records by ID with a specific list of fields, and using the cursor to page through large result sets. There's also information about the relation between the mindat integer ID and the new LongID strings. 

## Getting Started
If you do not have a Mindat API key, please refer to [How to Get My Mindat API Key or Token?](https://www.mindat.org/a/how_to_get_my_mindat_api_key)
